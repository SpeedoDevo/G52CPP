> HALL OF FAME: Well done, you got an outstanding mark. I would love to be able to add this to the hall of fame. If you agree, please send to me the files which need to be added to the web page (a stand-alone zip, an image and instructions) when you have time after the exams. You MAY fix any issues and/or make any improvements if you wish.

> ## Quality feedback section
>
> ### Code style and readability: 15 from 15
> The first marker had no problems following your code.  
> You seemed to be using a consistent naming style for your variables/classes/functions  
> You appropriately named your main classes using your username  
> Your source files had appropriate names  
> You appropriately indented your code  
> Good use of comments :)  
> You used const appropriately  
> Nice use of appropriate functions  
> The structure of your code seems to be appropriate for the program  
>
> ### Efficiency: 14 from 15
> It's well written with no obvious inefficiencies - well done.  
> You have some memory leaks from allocating objects but never deleting them  
> Extra comment: You use malloc() but not free() in your stage class  
>
> ### Robustness, compilation, correctness and reliability: 30 from 30
> The program compiled with no important warnings. (Other than visual studio issues.) Well done.  
> The program ran with no problems. Well done.  
>
> ### Complexity: 30 from 30
> Wow! This is a really complex piece of work, well done.  
> There is a lot of complexity in the user displayable object class  
>
> ### Impact: 10 from 10
> Wow! This was a really impressive program and you probably spent too long on it  
> This program is beautiful, well done, you obviously put a lot of thought into this.  
> Extra comment: A game concept I have not seen before, implemented well and deseving of a high mark. Well done!  
>
> ## Features feedback section
>
> ### Conversion to container class: 1.0 from 1.0
> You appropriately changed the base class to use an STL container class
> Extra comment: Nice reasoning about the runtime complexity
>
> ### Create subclass of BaseEngine: 1.0 from 1.0
> A complex background was drawn, which is different to the demos
> Good use of an image to texture the background.
>
> ### Create tile manager subclass: 1.0 from 1.0
> You've made a case for having met this criterion and we'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  
> Extra comment: An interesting use; not quite the idea but it works I suppose!  
>
> ### Create two displayable objects: 1.0 from 1.0
> You have complex moving objects, well done
>
> ### Create user controller object: 1.0 from 1.0
> You correctly created a user-controlled object
>
> ### Create automated object or basic AI: 1.0 from 1.0
> You created an appropriate automatically controlled object
>
> ### Load data: 0.5 from 0.5
> You have some simple loading of information
>
> ### Save data: 0.5 from 0.5
> You have some simple saving of information
>
> ### Support different states: 1.0 from 1.0
> You have support for more than two states, well done
> Well done on using an enum for the state rather than just an int
>
> ### Something must react and change: 1.0 from 1.0
> Your moving objects interact with each other
>
> ### Documentation file must exist: 1.0 from 1.0
> The documentation is well organized and provides all details of your game.
